        <section> 
            <p class="titulo">Brasília</p> 
            <article id="texto1"> 
                <p> The Federal District is one of the 27 federative units of Brazil and is where its capital, Brasília, founded on April 21, 1960, is located. 
                    Brasília was built in 4 years with the intention of moving the country's capital, which was then in Rio de Janeiro. </p> 
                    <p> The Federal District is different from other Brazilian federations because it is a region with autonomous administration, neither a state nor a municipality. 
                        Urbanizations located outside the Plano Pilot are called administrative regions or satellite cities, and the seat of its government is located in Brasília. </p> 
                        <p> Brasília is a city that represents a utopia full of grandeur and monumentality. 
                            According to Amaral (2003, p. 303), the construction of Brasília meant the opening of a new focus on development and achievements in the Midwest, which made it possible to expand communication between distant regions, which then had the Brazilian capital as a meeting point. 
                            In 1891, a commission led by the astronomer and director of the Rio de Janeiro Astronomical Observatory, Luís Cruls, was created to initiate the transition of the Brazilian capital to the Midwest. 
                            Known as the Cruls mission, it was the first official initiative towards making this change a reality (Braga-Falcão, 1997, p. 2). 
                            The Commission carried out a land demarcation work, delimiting an area of 14,400 Km² between 1892 and 1894, currently known as the "Cruls Quadrilateral", which was used as a basis for future projects to change the capital. </p> 
                            <p> The construction of Brasília began in 1956 and was instituted by President Juscelino Kubitschek, who also appointed Israel Pinheiro, engineer and federal deputy for the PSD, as president of the construction, Dr. Ernesto Silva as administrative director, engineer Bernardo Sayão as technical director, Íris Meinberg, a member of the UDN at the time, as financial director, and Oscar Niemeyer was appointed to the position of director of the Department of Architecture (Figueiredo, 1979, p. 15). 
                                A contest for the realization of the new capital was established, and Lúcio Costa won with a project that made the new capital a modern and monumental place. </p>

                                <p> The Pilot Plan was divided into 4 scales:</p> 
                                <p> Monumental</p> 
                                <p> – Where the main federal and local administrative activities are concentrated: Three Powers, Palácio do Planalto – seat of the executive branch – Supreme Federal Court – seat of the Judiciary – and the National Congress – seat of the legislative branch –, all designed by Niemeyer. 
                                    Also included in Niemeyer's signature are the Esplanade of Ministries, the Itamaraty Palace, the Cathedral, the National Theater, and the National Museum of the Republic. 
                                    The TV Tower and the Bus Platform were designed by Lúcio Costa.</p> 
                                    <p> Residential </p> 
                                    <p> – It has the Eixo Rodoviário as its backbone, along which we find the superblocks, with residential areas, schools, clubs, libraries, churches, etc.</p> 
                                    <p> Gregarious </p> 
                                    <p>– Located at the intersections of the axes, we find the Banking, Hotel, Commercial, and Entertainment sectors.</p> 
                                    <p> Bucolic – Formed by free and wooded areas, making Brasília a park city. 
                                        It permeates the other three scales and is very present on the shores of Lake Paranoá.</p> 
                                        <p> Brasília is a city with strong cultural and economic tourism, classified as "A" in terms of the influx of various types of tourists. I
                                            ts modern and unique architectural lines make Brasília an appealing city, with some of the most attractive cultural monuments being the Square of the Three Powers, 
                                            the Metropolitan Cathedral of Brasília, the JK Museum, the JK Bridge, among other monuments. </p>
